    <h2>Selected Student Comments</h2>
    <p class="small"><em>"I LOVE SHERA! She is always in touch with us students. She is always available, professional, positive and she simplifies and breaks down everything that's difficult. I hope she stays as a TA because I know other students will benefit from her."</em></p>
    <p class="small"><em>"Most likely the best TA I've had at Kellogg so far. Incredibly thorough with the TA notes and email responses. I'd love to have Shera as my TA again."</em></p>
    <p class="small"><em>"Incredibly organized and clear – her TA notes were literal godsend! Loved that she incorporated weekly student questions and reexplained things incredibly clearly on the TA notes! Best TA and TA notes ever!"</em></p>
    <p class="small"><em>"Shera was extremely accessible & sent out very valuable notes each week. Best TA I've ever had."</em></p>
    <p class="small"><em>"Extremely enthusiastic with notes and explanations."</em></p>
    <p class="small"><em>"Very knowledgeable about the subject matter. Went through all the important points and answered any questions I had. Recorded sessions and was very helpful in cementing knowledge for the course."</em></p>
